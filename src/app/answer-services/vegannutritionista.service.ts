      answer: [
        "If everyone was a vegetarian, we would actually have more food to feed hungry people across the world. Most of the grain we produce is fed to animals, and if we stopped doing that, no one would be starving. The cattle population across the world eats enough calories to feed 8.7 billion people.",
        "Additionally, a great deal of the Earth is cleared to make room for animal farms. The natural ecosystem and makes it harder for certain plants to grow and thrive. If we stopped clearing land for animal grazing, there would be more land for crops to feed humans."

      answer: [
        'It is true that if we stopped eating all animals today, there would be billions of farm animals who would "go to waste." But there\'s no way that would ever happen. The likely scenario is that we would gradually decrease the amount of meat we eat, and factory farmers would gradually decrease the number of animals they bred for food.',
        "Eventually there would be no more farm animals than any other species on Earth and the ecosystem would return to a natural balance. There are numerous reports that show the measurable difference it would make if the inhabitants of Earth would eat a vegetarian diet."

        "If we were to imagine ourselves back in the wild, without any of the modern world, we wouldn't be part of the same food chain with chickens and cows. It's more likely we would be eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and the occasional small animal like squirrels and other rodents.",
        "Besides, if we are going to ask this anti-vegan question, shouldn't we then make ourselves use the same methods for killing animals as other animals? That would mean we would need to hide behind bushes and hunt the animals, slaughter them ourselves, and process them. Our food system has nothing to do with nature's original purpose.",

Carnivores have short digestive tracts, sharp claws, and curved fangs; humans have long digestive tracts for vegetable matter, flat thin nails made for protection from dings, and flat teeth for grinding at plant protein.

      answer: [
        "I simply do not believe in harming animals just to satisfy my tastes, so for most vegans, the answer is a flat no. If you mean from the perspective of damage to the environment, the answer actually still no. Factory farming devastates fertile lands to clear space to grow GMO crops to feed farm animals and emits overwhelming amounts of methane gas. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of global climate change, as stated by the United Nations.",
        'However, while "sustainable" farming uses more appropriate farming practices, there is simply not enough space on the planet to allow animals to graze freely and still fill the current demand for animal products. The documentary Cowspiracy covers this concept in depth and I highly recommend seeing it on Netflix. The only true sustainable option is for us to stop eating animal products now. It would make a vast difference for the environment.'

Mock meats and cheeses are often expensive, but the standard diet of grains, vegetables, beans, and fruits is pretty cheap.

The easiest thing to do is follow along with what you believe, and don't force yourself to make changes faster than you feel comfortable. If you try to abstain from something just because you know you should, but you are not truly ready to do so, you are more likely to bounce back and start eating meat again.",

Most people actually eat too much protein, and when the body has more than it needs, it excretes the rest in our urine. Animal protein also leads to increased risk for several llnesses.",

        "Contrary to popular belief, animals are not raised on old-fashioned farms where they walk around on grassy fields, make babies when they are ready, and crow to wake up the farmers. Modern farms (commonly called factory farms) are made to process animals as quickly, cheaply, and efficiently as possible. Animals are never given medical care, are often genetically engineered, and are fed hormones, antibiotics, and medicine. They are not treated well, by any stretch of the imagination.",

      answer: [
        "Cows produce milk in the same way that humans do- when they have a baby. In nature, the calf would drink his mother's milk and then she would no longer have a supply of milk. On factory farms, dairy cows are artificially inseminated so that they constantly have milk. They also have their calf taken away from them immediately after birth and are made into either veal cows (males) or future dairy cows (females.)",
        "https://www.vegan-nutritionista.com/factory-farms.html#cows",
        "Additionally, dairy cows are given growth hormones so that they produce much more milk than they would have in nature. Those hormones cause their udders to be engorged with milk, which leads to infection and intense pain for the cow. When her udders are attached to the milking machines, the udders grow external infections, fill with cuts and puss, and hurt her.",
        "Once they are no longer able to produce a large amount of milk, they are slaughtered. Needless to say, milking a cow does hurt the cow."

        "The egg laying hens go through some of the worst abuse of any factory-farmed animal. These hens are packed into cages with numerous other hens, and those cages are stacked several layers high. As the hens on the top defecate, the poop falls into the cages below. The hens are unable to stretch their wings or legs, and often develop severe bone disorders. When the chickens die, they are often left in the cages where the other hens trample them as they begin to grow around the wires.",

        'A product can be labeled as "cage-free" or "free-range" if the animal had access to the outside, no matter how unrealistic that access is for the animals. In most cases, the access is a tiny door to a tiny yard that the animals never use because their feed is located inside the barn.',

However, with the strenuous demand on slaughterhouses in the modern era, often the animals are cut improperly, are still alive when slaughtered, or a number of other awful scenarios.

The animal industry leeches these resources from humans, especially food and water. By spending so much money and resources on feeding and watering animals for human consumption (mostly in Western countries), we are stealing it from people who need it most.",
